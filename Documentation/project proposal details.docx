1. Introduction: 
Orphanage management system is a website interconnecting our nation’s NGOs, civil society and orphanages to eradicate the hopeless conditions of the orphanages due to lack of proper communication between donors and receivers and seeking parents. There are a lot of orphanages existing in our country at this current time and there are a lot of eager parents and donors to help these orphanages prosper. Orphanage management system is the platform where these two parties with a mutual interest meet and take conclusive decisions to reach their desired goals in an effective and authentic manner.
